--- Personal Thoughts

Before starting this project, I had spent a few weeks learning basic web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JS, Express, Mongoose, Pug, etc. following a tutorial from MDN that focused on express.

From that, I had confidence I could build a CRUD app similar to the Appian cross-platform apps that I was working on at my day job.

I decided to focus on a simple problem which was tracking my budget and utilize a basic frontend library (Bootstrap).

Project management was largely a success though actual development was messy. I was learning and developing at the same time and therefore ran into issues with modularity and making the code easy to read/reusable.

Additionally, I had started experiencing burnout from working on the project after hours. I had also realized that because I couldn't access OFX (Open Financial Exchange) and didn't have the know-how to troubleshoot that, I was limited to manual input of transaction data.

All in all, it seemed to me that the project was outliving its usefulness. Since I had already experienced what developing with this tech stack would feel like and the app's actual utility to me seemed limited.

What I wish I had touched on more would be the actual modularity and unit testing aspects of the project. Going forward, these aspects could make managing the code for a project much easier.

--- Do it again?

I don't think I'd develop a CRUD app like this again. While it was cool to learn the tech, the usecase already seemed limited from the start.

Without the motivation to create something interesting, I faltered quite a bit on this project and ultimately I left it unfinished.

For my next project, I think an important thing to consider is the creativity involved in making something actually interesting and not a clone of a project that I may do at my day job.
